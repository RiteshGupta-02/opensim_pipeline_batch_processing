[info] Step 2: Scaling generic model
[info] Loaded marker file D:\UG_Proj\Human Sitting to Walking Transitions\S02\scale\../ExpData/Mocap/trcResults/static.trc (36 markers, 599 frames)
[info] Measurement 'pelvis'
[info] 	pair 0 (RASIS, LASIS): model = 0.256928, experimental = 0.275561
[info] 	overall scale factor = 1.07252
[info] Measurement 'thigh'
[info] 	pair 0 (RASIS, RFLE): model = 0.504880, experimental = 0.499777
[info] 	pair 1 (LASIS, LFLE): model = 0.504880, experimental = 0.512273
[info] 	overall scale factor = 1.00227
[info] Measurement 'shank'
[info] 	pair 0 (RFLE, RFAL): model = 0.390904, experimental = 0.446861
[info] 	pair 1 (LFLE, LFAL): model = 0.390904, experimental = 0.430042

[info] 	pair 1 (LFCC, LFMT1): model = 0.231559, experimental = 0.208498
[info] 	overall scale factor = 0.904857
[info] Wrote model file 'subject02_scaledOnly.osim' from model.
[info] Wrote scale file 'subject02_scaleSet_applied.xml' for model subject02.
[info] Step 3: Placing markers on model
[info] Loaded marker file D:\UG_Proj\Human Sitting to Walking Transitions\S02\scale\../ExpData/Mocap/trcResults/static.trc (36 markers, 599 frames)
[info] Averaged frames from time 0.0 to 1.0 in D:\UG_Proj\Human Sitting to Walking Transitions\S02\scale\../ExpData/Mocap/trcResults/static.trc (frames 1 to 201)
[info] Deleted 0 unused markers from model subject02.
[info] Frame at (t = 0.0):	 total squared error = 0.042162, marker error: RMS = 0.0342223, max = 0.0582024 (RSK4)
[info] Moved markers in model subject02 to match locations in marker file 'D:\UG_Proj\Human Sitting to Walking Transitions\S02\scale\../ExpData/Mocap/trcResults/static.trc'.
[info] Wrote model file 'subject02_simbody_scaled.osim' from model subject02.
[info] Wrote marker file 'subject02_marker_scaled.xml' from model subject02.
